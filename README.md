### Descriptiion

In today’s world, technology and business are becoming more and more integrated to resolve customer needs and demands. Managers must be open minded to adapt to the ever-changing technology and be ready to grab any opportunity to stay up beat with the market. There is currently a huge market in the world for IT professionals. Still with the fast-paced growth in the IT Industry the small to medium sized recruiting and staffing companies are facing numerous challenges in their day to day operations. The challenges arise from talent shortage in the market, high expectations of client managers, finding the perfect match with the right skill set, keeping up with the fast-paced competition and the biggest factor of finding and managing technical recruiters for these recruiting companies.
For an IT staffing company there is a constant pressure to beat the competition as the client might have tie-ups with 20 other vendors. There can be up to 30 recruiters working on the same position for a client at any given time. To stay ahead in this business the companies need to have a fast and efficient process to meet the ever-changing needs of their multiple clients. The key to success to any IT Recruiting/Staffing company is to have an efficient process in place with a team of high performing recruiters. These recruiters should be apt in technical knowledge to understand the client's requirement to be able to find the right match. As the clients are usually looking for specific talents and specific skill sets for their projects. The process of recruitment may vary in different companies, but the general guideline starts with understanding client requirements>   shortlisting resumes > Verification of applicant’s information > Interview > Evaluating technical skills> Employment Verification > Assignment to the client’s project. The process might seem easy but requires strenuous labor from the recruiter’s side to find a right match. Also, coordination between the manager and the client with so many recruiters working on various positions makes things hard to manage.
 As the size of these companies grows so does the complexity of managing these resources, thus evolves a need for an IT service provider which can understand the business need and provide the necessary service. This project proposes a solution for managing the day to day operations of a recruiting/staffing organization in the most efficient way with the implementation of a recruiting app.  Recruiting company’s executive leadership can rely on this application for managing its recruiting team, clients and candidates to expedite the recruiting process and stay ahead for their competitors.
